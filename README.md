# GeekIt for Chrome
A ported bookmarklet to post geeky links to Geeklist communities and your profile.

## Why?

BECAUSE! It's cool to use Chrome extensions instead of bookmarklets because they're easier to access and it was fun to implement it.

## How?
"Stealing" it from the original bookmarklet done by the Geeklist team and heavily adapting it to make it work within the Chrome extension with manifest version 2.
